      <h2>A brief history</h2>
      <div class="history">
        The flaky, buttery croissant originally comes from Austria, not France.
        Legend says it celebrated Austria's victory over the Ottoman Turks in
        1683, with its shape symbolizing "devouring" the enemy's crescent
        emblem. The pastry arrived in France in the 1830s when Austrian baker
        August Zang opened a Viennese bakery in Paris. The French renamed it
        "croissant" (meaning crescent). The modern, layered butter technique
        that creates its distinctive flakiness was developed by French bakers in
        the early 20th century, transforming the once bread-like pastry into the
        French icon we know today.
